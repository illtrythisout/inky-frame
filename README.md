# Inky Frame

A personal DIY project that combines a RaspberryPi and an E-ink screen to create a custom electronic picture frame.  
This project includes code to control the screen alongside a full-stack web interface to process and upload images to the **Inky Frame**

## Components

- [Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/)
- [7.3inch ACeP 7-Color E-Paper E-Ink Display Module, 800Ã—480 Pixels, SPI Communication](https://www.waveshare.com/product/displays/e-paper/epaper-1/7.3inch-e-paper-hat-f.htm)
